This seed provides the basic components that should be installed on an
Ubuntu-family desktop system. It is expected to be supplemented with a
particular flavour of desktop environment (e.g. GNOME, KDE, or XFCE).

= Hardware and Architecture Support =

== Architecture-independent ==

 * alsa-base # needed for proper hardware detection (hotplug/blacklist.d, modprobe.d)
 * alsa-utils           # basic audio support and mixer level handling
 * (pcmciautils)        # PCMCIA support for >= 2.6.13-rc1 kernels
 * inputattach          # needed for serial mice
 * ubuntu-drivers-common # Make it harder to remove detection support, LP#704597 

Power management:

 * (acpi-support)

== armel ==

 * apmd [armel]

== ppc32, ppc64 ==

 * pbbuttonsd [powerpc]

= Console-Based Tools =

These tools are very commonly used by people who drop into a console shell to do some work.

 * bc
 * genisoimage
 * zip
 * unzip                # also used for .zip support in file-roller

= Network Services =

Basic network services and Windows integration.

 * wireless-tools
 * rfkill              # No longer using the copy from wireless-tools (LP: #715309)
 * wpasupplicant  # ScottJamesRemnant
 * ca-certificates     # common SSL certificates

These packages help with system integration

 * libsasl2-modules    # allows integration with MTA and login system

= Printing =

Printing and printer configuration is a real weak spot in Debian, and in Linux in general. We will need to stay at the front of the curve here.

 * ghostscript-x

= GUI infrastructure =

Packages used for X preconfiguration are just Recommends; removing them after initial installation should be relatively safe.

 * (laptop-detect)

 * xorg                          # this includes xserver-xorg->xserver-xorg-{input|video}-* (no need to add specific drivers manually)
 * !linux-image-*                # xorg transitively depends on this, but this would pull in grub-pc; we handle that separately
 * xkb-data                      # XKB data now lives here

Fonts:

 * fonts-dejavu-core
 * (fonts-takao-pgothic)

= Debugging and Diagnostics =

 * memtest86+

= Other =

 * anacron # generally appropriate for desktops
 * libxp6 # required for some third party apps. See #21953
 * (policykit-desktop-privileges) # passwordless disk/CPU speed/time operations for admins
 * ubuntu-extras-keyring # archive signing key for extras.ubuntu.com
 * libpam-systemd # logind, cross desktop compatibility
