Ubiquity needs full filesystem support for the partitioner.

 * hfsplus [powerpc]  # ColinWatson
 * reiserfsprogs
 * ntfs-3g

# workaround for a broken aufs/overlayfs (e. g. LP #587888); also needs
# cdimage change to use union=unionfs-fuse kernel parameter
# * unionfs-fuse

# * (bootchart) [!armel] # scheduled for removal before maverick beta

== Germinate workarounds ==

 * wamerican  # iamerican Depends: ispell Recommends: wordlist, but wamerican isn't spotted in time so germinate arbitrarily picks miscfiles instead
